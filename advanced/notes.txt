PHP Create/Retrieve a Cookie

    The example creates a cookie named "user" with the value "John Doe". The cookie will expire after 30 days 
    (86400 * 30). The "/" means that the cookie is available in entire website (otherwise, select the directory 
    you prefer).

    We then retrieve the value of the cookie "user" (using the global variable $_COOKIE). We also use the isset() 
    function to find out if the cookie is set


Modify a Cookie Value

    To modify a cookie, just set (again) the cookie using the setcookie() function


Delete a Cookie

    To delete a cookie, use the setcookie() function with an expiration date in the past

Check if Cookies are Enabled

    The following example creates a small script that checks whether cookies are enabled. First, try to create 
    a test cookie with the setcookie() function, then count the $_COOKIE array variable

PHP Session SOURCE: https://www.w3schools.com/php/php_sessions.asp 
NOTE: The session_start() function must be the very first thing in your document. Before any HTML tags.
start session:
    A session is started with the session_start() function.
    Session variables are set with the PHP global variable: $_SESSION.
    
    create a new page called "demo_session1.php". In this page, we start a new PHP session and set some session 
    variables

get session values:
    Next, we create another page called "demo_session2.php". From this page, we will access the session 
    information we set on the first page ("demo_session1.php").

    Notice that session variables are not passed individually to each new page, instead they are retrieved from 
    the session we open at the beginning of each page (session_start()).

    all session variable values are stored in the global $_SESSION variable

modify: overwrite

Destroy a PHP Session:
    To remove all global session variables and destroy the session 
    use session_unset() and session_destroy()
